# Recipe-Ontology
We proposed a standard recipe ontology that can model all kinds of recipes and integrate different websites to bridge the heterogeneity across multiple sources. We also identify the ingredient type, value, units, actions, state of ingredient, time, temperature, and tools from the ingredients and instructions that would be a major milestone towards recipes evolution.
